# CHIP-8 Intrepeter
Following this great [guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/). Change the variable `romsource` to load the rom file you want. Might be buggy not sure.

Has a sound timer but doesn't make any sound lol

Compile with `` gcc main.c `sdl2-config --cflags --libs\` ``
